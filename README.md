<h1>Hi, my name is Bartosz and I invite you to take a look at my portfolio.</h1>

As it develops, you will find <b>a number of test cases and bugs found here</b>.

My career so far has been in marketing, particularly digital marketing, so I know how important it is to not only have a good product, but also a properly functioning website that leads to that product. On more than one occasion, both professionally and privately, I have reported all kinds of errors that I have encountered along the way and which I know that, from the user's point of view, can even cause the path taken to be abandoned.

Even though I know that there are no perfect websites and applications, I have decided that I want to be part of the process of creating them, where I can use my experience gained both in creating and designing websites on the wordpress platform and in analysing consumer paths.
